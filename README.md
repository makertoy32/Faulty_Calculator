# Faulty Calculator  

A simple JavaScript calculator with a twist â€” it doesnâ€™t always give the correct answer!  

## ðŸ”¹ Features  
- Performs basic arithmetic operations: **addition, subtraction, multiplication, division**.  
- Simulates a **faulty calculator** in two ways:  
  1. **Faulty Logic (10% chance):**  
     - Randomly replaces the intended operation with another one.  
     - Example: `2 + 3` â†’ becomes `2 - 3`.  
  2. **Faulty Result (Random Offset):**  
     - Sometimes adds or subtracts a small random value (between `-5` and `+4`) to the final answer.  

## ðŸ”¹ Example  
- Input: `2 + 3`  
- Correct Answer: `5`  
- Faulty Answer (offset method): `8`  
- Faulty Answer (logic swap): `-1`  

ðŸ‘‰ You never know what answer youâ€™ll get! ðŸŽ²  

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose  
This project was created for **fun and learning**. It demonstrates:  
- Handling button input in **JavaScript**.  
- **DOM manipulation** for updating the calculator screen.  
- Using **randomness** to simulate faulty logic.
