Faulty Calculator

A simple JavaScript calculator with a twist â€” it doesnâ€™t always give the correct answer!

Features

Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Simulates a faulty calculator in two ways:

Faulty Logic (10% chance):

Randomly replaces the intended operation with another one (e.g., 2 + 3 may become 2 - 3).

Faulty Result (Random Offset):

Sometimes adds or subtracts a small random value (between -5 and +4) to the final answer.

Example

Input: 2 + 3

Correct Answer: 5

Faulty Answer (offset method): 8

Faulty Answer (logic swap): -1

You never know what answer youâ€™ll get! ðŸŽ²

Purpose

This project is created for fun and learning purposes. It demonstrates:

Handling button input in JavaScript.

DOM manipulation.

Introducing randomness in program logic.
